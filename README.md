### Setup
To run this App locally:
1. Git clone this repo.
2. Open up the app and run 'npm install'
3. Seed database 'npm run seed'
4. Start app dev env 'npm run dev:start'
5. Open browser 'localhost:8080'

### Other commands
Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!
- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
- start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately)
